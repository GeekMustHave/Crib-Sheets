These are crib notes.  Everytime I look something up more tha once I try to add
it to this document

== MSAccess

=== Substring (MID)

The Microsoft Access Mid function extracts a substring from a string (starting at any position).

----
Mid ( text, start_position, [number_of_characters] )
----

Source:  https://www.techonthenet.com/access/functions/string/mid.php

=== Format values

The Format function does exactly the same thing as formatting a number or a date within a cell in a spreadsheet, 
except it does so from within the code itself. If you wish to display a number in a message box or on a user form, 
this function is very useful for making it readable, particularly if it is a large number

.Examples
----
Format(1234567.89, "#,###.#")

format(([On_Hand]-[Qty_Needed]), "#,##0[Black];(#,##0)[Red];0;0")

sReturn = Format(sValueIS, "$###,###,###,##0[Black];($###,###,###,##0)[Red];;")
----

[cols="2,8", options='header']
.Predefined Formats
|===
|Format Name	|Description
|General Number	|Display the number as is.
|Currency	|Display the number with currency symbol. Use thousand separator. 
Enclose in brackets if negative. Display to two decimal places.
|Fixed	|Display at least one digit to the left and two digits to the right of the decimal point.
|Standard	|Display number with thousand separator. Display to two decimal places.
|Percent	|Display number multiplied by 100 with a percent sign (%) appended after. Display to two decimal places.
|Scientific	|Use standard scientific notation.
|Yes/No	|Display No if number is 0; otherwise, display Yes.
|True/False	|Display False if number is 0; otherwise, display True.
|On/Off	|Display Off if number is 0; otherwise, display On.
|===

A number of characters can be used to define a user-defined format, as shown below.
The format string can have up to four sections separated by semicolons (;). 
This is so different formats can be applied to different values, such as to positive and negative numbers. 
For example, you may wish to show brackets/parentheses around a negative value


.Section	Detail
[cols="2,8", options='header']
|===
|Number of Sections | Formatting
|One section only	|Applies to all values
|Two sections	|First section for positive values, second section for negative values
|Three sections	|First section for positive values, second section for negative values, third section for zeros
|Four sections	|First section for positive values, second section for negative values, third section for zeros, fourth section for null values
|=== 

.User-Defined Formats
[cols="2,8", options='header']
|===
|Character	|Description
|Null String	|No formatting.
|0	|Digit placeholder. Displays a digit or a zero. If there is a digit for that position, then it displays the digit; otherwise, it displays 0. If there are fewer digits than zeros, you will get leading or trailing zeros. If there are more digits after the decimal point than there are zeros, then the number is rounded to the number of decimal places shown by the zeros. If there are more digits before the decimal point than zeros, these will be displayed normally.
|#	|Digit placeholder. This displays a digit or nothing. It works the same as the preceding zero placeholder, except that leading and trailing zeros are not displayed. For example, 0.75 would be displayed using zero placeholders, but this would be .75 using # placeholders.
|.Decimal point.	|Only one permitted per format string. This character depends on the settings in the Windows Control Panel.
|%	|Percentage placeholder. Multiplies number by 100 and places % character where it appears in the format string.
|,	|Thousand separator. This is used if 0 or # placeholders are used and the format string contains a comma. One comma to the left of the decimal point means to round to the nearest thousand (e.g., ##0,). Two adjacent commas to the left of the thousand separator indicate rounding to the nearest million (e.g., ##0,,).

|E- E+	|Scientific format. This displays the number exponentially.
|:	|Time separator-used when formatting a time to split hours, minutes, and seconds.
|/	|Date separator-this is used when specifying a format for a date.
|- + � $ ( )	|Displays a literal character. To display a character other than listed here, precede it with a backslash (\).
|===


.Predefined Date and Time Formats
[cols="2,5", options='header']
|===
|Format Name	|Description
|General Date	|Display a date and/or time. For real numbers, display date and time. Integer numbers display time only. If there is no integer part, then display only time.
|Long Date	|Displays a long date as defined in the international settings of the Windows Control Panel.
|Medium Date	|Displays a date as defined in the short date settings of the Windows Control Panel, except it spells out the month abbreviation.
|Short Date	|Displays a short date as defined in the International settings of the Windows Control Panel.
|Long Time	|Displays a long time as defined in the International settings of the Windows Control Panel.
|Medium Time	|Displays time in a 12-hour format using hours, minutes, and seconds and the AM/PM format.
|Short Time	|Displays a time using 24-hour format (e.g., 18:10).
|===

=== Hide second column in Combo box

In Visual Basic, the ColumnWidth property setting is an Integer value that represents the column width in twips. You can specify a width or use one of the following predefined settings.

.Special ColmnWidth Values
[cols="1,8", options='header']
|===
|Setting	|Description
|0	|Hides the column.
|1	|(Default) Sizes the column to the default width.
|===

=== Refresh form with new QueryDef SQL

You can't requery, you have to refresh the subform's source object:
----
MySubformControl.SourceObject = ""
MySubformControl.SourceObject = "Query.MyQuery"
----

=== Convert expression to data type ( C )

The function name determines the return type as shown in the following:

[cols="2,2,8", options='header']
|===
|Function |Return Type |Range for expression argument
|CBool|Boolean|Any valid string or numeric expression.
|CByte|Byte|0 to 255.
|CCur|Currency|-922,337,203,685,477.5808 to 922,337,203,685,477.5807.
|CDate|Date|Any valid date expression.
|CDbl|Double|-1.79769313486231E308 to-4.94065645841247E-324 for negative values; 4.94065645841247E-324 to 1.79769313486232E308 for positive values.
|CDec|Decimal|+/-79,228,162,514,264,337,593,543,950,335 for zero-scaled numbers, that is, 
numbers with no decimal places. For numbers with 28 decimal places, the range is
+/-7.9228162514264337593543950335. The smallest possible non-zero number is 0.0000000000000000000000000001.
|CInt|Integer|-32,768 to 32,767; fractions are rounded.
|CLng|Long|-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647; fractions are rounded.
|CSng|Single|-3.402823E38 to -1.401298E-45 for negative values; 1.401298E-45 to 3.402823E38 for positive values.
|CStr|String|Returns for CStr depend on the expression argument.
|CVar|Variant|Same range as Double for numerics. Same range as String for non-numerics.
|===

=== Creating User Properties (Tables / Queries)

You can create user-defined properties for persistent DAO objects, 
such as tables and queries. You can't create properties for nonpersistent objects, such as recordsets. 
To create a user-defined property, you must first create the property, 
using the Database's CreateProperty method. 
You then append the property using the Properties collection's Append method. That's all there is to it.

Using the example of a field's Description property, the following code demonstrates just how easy it is:

----
Public Sub SetFieldDescription(strTableName As String, _
    strFieldName As String, _
    varValue As Variant, _
)
    Dim dbs As DAO.Database
    Dim prop As DAO.Property
    Set dbs = CurrentDb

    'Create the property
    Set prop = dbs.CreateProperty("Description", dbText, varValue)

    'Append the property to the object Properties collection
    dbs(strTableName)(strFieldName).Properties.Append prop
    Debug.Print dbs(strTableName)(strFieldName).Properties("Description")

    'Clean up
    Set prop = Nothing
    Set dbs = Nothing
End Sub
----

Source: https://sourcedaddy.com/ms-access/setting-and-retrieving-built-in-object-properties.html

=== Turn off datasheet Sort/Filter

On design view go to the properties page. Under the "Other" or "All" tab find Shortcut Menu. 
Change that property from Yes to No and save. 
Be warned though that this will disable all shortcuts for the form and not just the drop down filter/sort menus on column headings in datasheet view.

=== Requery a form from another form


----
e.dirty = false
Forms!frmLegacy.Requery
----

Source: http://www.utteraccess.com/forum/Requery-Form-Form-t2001669.html


=== Relinking table VBA

----
Function ReLinkTable(strTable As String, strPath As String) As Boolean
  ' Comments: Re-links the named table to the named path
  ' Params  : strTable     Table name of the linked table
  ' strPath : full path name of the database containing the real table
  ' Returns : True if successful, False otherwise
  
  Dim fOK As Boolean
  Dim dbs As DAO.Database
  Dim tdf As DAO.TableDef
  Dim strPrefix As String
  Dim strNewConnect As String

  fOK = False
  
  On Error GoTo PROC_ERR

  Set dbs = CurrentDb() 
  Set tdf = dbs.TableDefs(strTable)
 
  strPrefix = Left$(tdf.Connect, InStr(tdf.Connect, "="))
  strNewConnect = strPrefix & strPath

  tdf.Connect = strNewConnect
  tdf.RefreshLink

  fOK = True

PROC_EXIT:
  dbs.Close
  ReLinkTable = fOK
  Exit Function

PROC_ERR:
  Resume PROC_EXIT
End Function

=== Sort Hidden properties of datasheet

The properties in Access related to datasheets.

[cols="2,8", options='header']
.Hidden Properties
|===
|Property | Meaning and Usage
|ColumnHidden	|Exists on columns in the datasheet, controls whether the column is visible or not.
|ColumnWidth	|Exists on columns in the datasheet, controls the width of the column.
|DatasheetBackColor	|Exists on the datasheet itself, specifies the background color for the whole datasheet.
|DatasheetCellsEffect	|Exists on the datasheet itself, handles whether special effects are used for the cells (flat, raised, or sunken are the only effects supported).
|DatasheetFontHeight	|Exists on the datasheet itself, this unfortunately named property specifies the font size.
|DatasheetFontItalic	|Exists on the datasheet itself, controls whether all of the text is italic.
|DatasheetFontName	|Exists on the datasheet itself, controls the name of the font.
|DatasheetFontUnderline	|Exists on the datasheet itself, controls whether all of the text is underlined.
|DatasheetFontWeight	|Exists on the datasheet itself, controls whether the text is bolded.
|DatasheetForeColor	|Exists on the datasheet itself, specifies the foreground color for the whole datasheet.
|DatasheetGridlinesBehavior	|Exists on the datasheet itself, controls which gridlines will be displayed (if any).
|DatasheetGridlinesColor	|Exists on the datasheet itself, specifies the color of the gridlines.
|FrozenColumns	|Exists on the datasheet itself, specifies how many columns have been frozen by the user (discussed later in the article).
|ShowGrid	|Exists on the datasheet itself, but has been superseded by the DatasheetGridlinesBehavior property.
|SubdatasheetExpanded	|Exists on the datasheet itself, specifies whether all subdatasheets should be expanded. (Access 2000 only)
|SubdatasheetHeight	|Exists on the datasheet itself, specifies the number of records to display for subdatasheets (a scrollbar appears if there are more records than this property allows). (Access 2000 only)
|SubdatasheetName	|Exists on the datasheet itself, specifies the name of the table's subdatasheet. (Access 2000 only)
|TabularCharSet	|Exists on the datasheet itself, and is hidden. It specifies the font character set and can often cause bad things to happen if it's set to an incorrect value. It's best not to set it, or to set it to 1 (which uses the DEFAULT_CHARSET for the machine).
|===

With the exception of the Subdatasheet properties, 
you have no direct design-time access to these properties: 
None of these properties show up in the datasheet's property sheet.
As a result, they can only be set at runtime from VBA code in order to make changes. 
Interestingly, none of the properties are exposed by ADO or ADOX, so if you want to change them, 
you'll have to use DAO.

While you can't access these properties through property sheets, many of them can be set in the user interface. 
They are, for example, what's changed when you set the font of a datasheet from the Format menu. 
For full control over the datasheet, though, 
you'll want to explicitly set the properties in code and save the object when you're done.

It's worth noting that a datasheet is a form�it says so right in the object browser. 
The object browser considers the datasheet's columns to be the controls on the form. 
As a result, a datasheet can consist of any control that can be displayed, 
which means all TextBox, ComboBox, and CheckBox controls.

=== Change Hide / Show of a field on datasheet

The code to show and hide the columns is in a routine called ShowHideColumn. 

----
Private Function ShowHideColumn()
    Dim sfrm As SubForm
    Dim ctl As Control
    Dim stCtl As String
    
    Set sfrm = Me.sfrmHideShowColumns
    For Each ctl In Me.Controls
        If TypeOf ctl Is Access.CheckBox Then
            stCtl = "tb" & Mid$(ctl.Name, 3)
            sfrm.Form(stCtl).ColumnHidden = _
                       Not ctl.Value
        End If
    Next ctl
End Function
----


=== Select Case (If-Then-Else)

The Microsoft Access Case statement can only be used in VBA code. It has the functionality of an IF-THEN-ELSE statement.

----
Select Case test_expression

   Case condition_1
      result_1
   Case condition_2
      result_2
   ...
   Case condition_n
      result_n

 [ Case Else
      result_else ]

End Select
----

Source: https://www.techonthenet.com/access/functions/advanced/case.php


=== Access columns of Combo control

Use 0 to refer to the first column, 1 to refer to the second column, 
and so on. Use 0 to refer to the first row, 1 to refer to the second row, 
and so on. For example, 
in a list box containing a column of customer IDs and a column of customer names, 
you could refer to the customer name in the second column (1) and fifth (4) row as:

If the user has made no selection when you refer to a column in a combo box or list box, 
the Column property setting will be Null. 
You can use the IsNull function to determine if a selection has been made

----
Forms!Contacts!Customers.Column(1, 4)

'*--- Empty combo selection
If IsNull(Forms!Customers!Country) 
  Then MsgBox "No selection." 
End If
----

=== Set Filter on Subform from Main Form

----
'*--- lstBoxSheets is the subForm
Me.LstBoxSheets.Form.Filter = "prjCategory='General'"
Me.LstBoxSheets.Form.FilterOn = True
----


=== Reset query Column Order setting 

So, when you open a query in Datasheet view, and the column order has not been messed with and saved, 
the column order displayed is determined by the OrdinalPosition and the value of that property corresponds 
to the order in which your columns appear in the query design grid (OrdinalPosition is 0 based, so 0 
is the first column).

Then ... when you move the column while viewing the query in Datasheet view, and subsequently 
save that change in the column order, Access creates the ColumnOrder property for each of the columns in the query. 
This property is not visible in the query design grid, but is definately there.

----
Public Sub ResetColumnOrder(strQueryName)
    Dim fld As DAO.Field
    Dim qdf As DAO.QueryDef
    
    Set qdf = CurrentDb.QueryDefs(strQueryName)
    
    For Each fld In qdf.Fields
        On Error Resume Next
        fld.Properties.Delete "ColumnOrder"
    Next fld
        
End Sub
----


=== Open Dynaset, change SQL

=== Open recordset, add row

----
Dim dbCurrent As Database
Dim rsNotes As Recordset
Dim sSQL As String

    sSQL = "Select * from PrePos where PostType = 'Help';"
    Set dbCurrent = CurrentDb
    Set rsNotes = dbCurrent.OpenRecordset(sSQL, dbOpenDynaset, dbSeeChanges)
    With rsNotes
        If .EOF Then
            .AddNew
            ![PostIMMTable] = gsNewTableName
            ![PostIMMField] = gsNewFieldName
            ![PostPtype] = gsPtype
            ![Notes] = Me.txtNotes
            ![UpdatedDate] = Now()
            ![UpdatedBy] = gsUserName
            .Update
            .Close
        End If
    End With
    Set rsNotes = Nothing
    Set dbCurrent = Nothing   
----        

=== Select Cased Statement (VBA)

----
Select Case test_expression

   Case condition_1
      result_1
   Case condition_2
      result_2
   ...
   Case condition_n
      result_n

 [ Case Else
      result_else ]

End Select
----





== MySQL

=== Like with Join

----
SELECT table1.*, table2.z
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
  ON table2.name LIKE CONCAT('%', table1.name, '%') 
 AND table1.year = table2.year
----

=== Update with Where

----
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
----

=== Count Distinct

You can use the DISTINCT clause within the COUNT function. For example, 
the SQL statement below returns the number of unique departments where at least one employee makes over $55,000 / year.

----
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT department) AS "Unique departments"
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 55000;
----

=== Count nulls

----
select sum(case when FirstName IS NULL then 1 else 0 end) as NUMBER_OF_NULL_VALUE from DemoTable;
----

Source: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-count-null-values-in-mysql

== SQL Server

=== Concat

----
CONCAT(string1, string2, ...., string_n)
----

=== Cast Number into string

----
CAST(expression AS datatype(length))
----

.Parameter Values
|===
|Value	|Description
|expression	|Required. The value to convert
|datatype	|Required. The datatype to convert expression to. Can be one of the following: bigint, int, smallint, tinyint, bit, decimal, numeric, money, smallmoney, float, real, datetime, smalldatetime, char, varchar, text, nchar, nvarchar, ntext, binary, varbinary, or image
